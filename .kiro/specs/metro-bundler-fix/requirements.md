# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Metro bundler connection issue in React Native development where the app cannot load scripts from the Metro server. The error "Unable to load script" occurs when the device/emulator cannot establish a connection to the Metro bundler running on localhost:8081. This is a critical development issue that prevents the app from running properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a React Native developer, I want the Metro bundler to be properly configured and accessible, so that I can run and test the application on devices and emulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Metro bundler is started THEN the system SHALL establish a connection on localhost:8081
2. WHEN a device or emulator attempts to connect THEN the system SHALL successfully load JavaScript bundles
3. WHEN using USB debugging THEN the system SHALL properly forward ports using adb
4. WHEN using network connection THEN the system SHALL allow devices on the same network to connect

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper network configuration for Metro bundler, so that both USB and WiFi connected devices can access the development server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using USB connection THEN the system SHALL configure adb port forwarding for tcp:8081
2. WHEN using WiFi connection THEN the system SHALL bind Metro to the correct network interface
3. WHEN Metro starts THEN the system SHALL display the correct connection URLs for different connection methods
4. IF network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Metro bundler to handle cache and build issues gracefully, so that I can resolve common development problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL provide commands to clear Metro cache
2. WHEN bundle loading fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to rebuild the bundle
3. WHEN port conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL either resolve the conflict or suggest alternative ports
4. WHEN Metro crashes THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Metro configuration for the project structure, so that all assets and modules are correctly resolved and bundled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Metro starts THEN the system SHALL correctly resolve all project dependencies
2. WHEN loading assets THEN the system SHALL properly bundle images, fonts, and other resources
3. WHEN using TypeScript THEN the system SHALL correctly transform and bundle TypeScript files
4. WHEN using custom transformers THEN the system SHALL apply them correctly during bundling
